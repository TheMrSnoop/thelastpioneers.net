    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>2024 Fall Update</h1>
    <h3>NOVEMBER 6, 2024 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">
        It had been over 4 months since the last build of the game. Most of that time was spent just refining, and perfecting the groundwork I had laid for all the core elements of The Last Pioneers.
    </p>

    <p>I spent a lot of time making a test map. It's a secret Soviet Facility that is located on the North Martian Pole. I might end up coming back to the barebones map, I might not, but it taught me a lot about level design, since it was kind of the first real level I would work on for the game.</p>

    <p>
        I decided to not use a tutorial mission I had spent June and July working on, and started working on a Military Basic Training level instead. This is where I spent about 2 months trying to perfect the place. 
    </p>

    <p>I also worked on, and created different variations of the "Interactive Landing Menu". Basically, I wanted something more than a simple UI, even if it looked cool. This is why I experimented with different effects, like warping, and such. It's important to note that I worked more on the look of it, rather than the functionality of it (it is still missing some basic features).</p>

    <p>
        I learned how to properly implement Artificial Intelligence using Unreal's blackboards and Behavior trees. I had made AI before, like the enemy ship AI in space combat, but it was entirely done in blueprint. I decided to make the ground troop enemy AI's using the Behavior tree so that it would be cleaner to work with.
