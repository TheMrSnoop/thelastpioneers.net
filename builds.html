            <h1  id="buildText">Getting Help and Playtesting for the first time </h1>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">January 12, 2025</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">It was during this time where my friends began to help with game development, and I needed to begin to build the game more often for frequent play-testing. I wanted them to play-test 3 levels. The Early Tutorial, Proteus (for the ariel combat), and what I had of the Abandoned city map for the time. The Basic Training level was incredibly unoptimized and ran at about 20fps on a RTX 4060...Optimization is something I often glance over because if it runs at, at least 60fps on my RX 7900XTX, I don't worry too much about it. The Russian City map, which runs at like 120 fps on my PC, wasn't even able to open on my friend's PC, without crashing the game. Safe to say, there is still a lot of work in terms of proper optimization to do. </p>

            <h1  id="buildText">SIXTH BUILD</h1>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">November 6, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Many many, many things were added between the nearly 4 months that had passed since the last build. This build was originally supposed to follow up the last build, where the player would raid the "Wing of Ares", and to do that I needed to finish the fps system. However, as time when on, and the scope of the game only got bigger, I constantly kept improving what I already had. Constantly kept polishing, and experimenting with different gameplay styles. Eventually, I formed a concrete enough of a foundation, and was able to finish the combat system. This build also includes other things like a complete tutorial sequence, artificial intelligence for NPC's and enemies, and many smaller things that have been added throughout this time. I'm still going to wait for the 7th build before making another showcase. You can read the <a href="devlog.html #July" style="color: wheat;">devlog</a> if you are interested in what else I added.</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">July 29, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Focused around an in-depth space combat system, lore cutscenes, and spent way too much time working on a early starter mission (that I just ended up scrapping since I barely had even started writing the story) I also gave a lot more depth to the FPS system by adding secondary weapons (grenades and throwing knives), levels and skills, and inventory systems.</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">June 12, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Included a showcase with parts of the last build, but mostly focused on a super rough and early intro mission for the game that was planned to serve as the tutorial. A mission that has completely been scraped as of writing this. Also added the first FPS animations, and a better FPS system (still basic).</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">May 19, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">This build added a landing sequence, launching sequence, and an immersive orbiting sequence. Along with a custom VHS shader for the game. I experimented with a HUD rendered entirely in 3D space. I have since reverted back to a typical 2D user interface. </p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">April 28, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Showcasing the earliest form of an actual game, with a minigame. Improved the experimental start screen. There was still not a clear enough direction of a main gameplay loop at this time, but there was a very bare-bones FPS system.</p>

            <p id="buildParagraph">April 21, 2024</p>
            <p id="buildParagraph" >Despite development starting a month prior, this was the very first build of the game. Mostly was created to make sure I hadn't screwed up the project settings (like for my last project). It included a rough stylized start screen, and the basics of all games. The game had a pixelation shader applied to everything, that is now being used for other cases.</p>
