    <h1>Starting Development on this Website</h1>
    <h3>SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">It was the beginning of the new school year, and this year I decided to take a Web Design class. And with me simultaneously working on a video game, I decided to slowly create this website of the course of the school year, as I learned more and more about HTML and CSS programming. I have worked on the same project the entire year, so that I could update the website as I went on, and I wouldn't have to go back and remember what I did for a specific month or whatever. This is why, this website has had like 10 personality crisis, and I have old commits on it's public github if anyone really wanted to see me get better at HTML and CSS over time.</p>

    <p>I find that working on this website is a good way for me to take a break from game development (so I don't get burned out) whilst still making progress on something about the game.</p>
