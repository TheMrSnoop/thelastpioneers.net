    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>Making a new intro mission, scrapping the old one</h1>
    <h3>JANUARY 28, 2025 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">After looking through the data I got from the first playtest, and spending the last 3 months working on it, I have decided to scrap the old tutorial/intro mission. I just felt like it was too boring, and wasn't probably wouldn't leave a good first impression on the player-base. It was mostly only go here, do this, learn that. I want something with more, action. It should introduce the player to cool characters, and be the start of new relationships with characters. </p>
    
    <p>I want players to play through the nuclear explosions. I want them to get a last look at the beautiful marble called Earth. The old one was set months after Earth is destroyed, and the only way the player would know what happened to Earth would be through snippets of dialog and lore. I realized that this could be a cool event to experience and try to survive first hand, so that is why the setting for this new intro mission is returning back to the Texan Space Base from July. However, I am changing a lot from the original intro mission, which, aside from it having even worse optimization, was one of the reasons why I didn't just go back to working on the old one. </p>

    <p>I made the map larger, so that when you eventually blast off into orbit, narrowly escaping the incoming nuclear missiles, the player can look down at a semi-detailed, nice looking island. After hearing the Emergency Warning, the player begins to fight killer robots that are dropping in from orbit. This is where the player is taught the basics of FPS combat, and I think this is much cooler than just walking into a shooting range because some guy you just met 2 minutes ago told you so.</p>

    <p>Does me constantly redoing things I spent months working on stall development by a lot? Of course, but I'd honestly rather spend years and years working on this admittedly very ambitious project, if that means people get to genuinely enjoy this indie RPG. </p>
