    <h6 style="padding-top: 5%;">The Brief Overview behind the idea</h6>
    <p>Now, every world (Planet or Moon) that you can land on, will have a "Mission Hub" scene. These scenes are of that world in orbit, with a space station in the foreground. So if your last mission was on The Moon, then you would be orbiting the moon with a lunar space station, while you navigate the UI to pick a new mission. These backgrounds are also sort of alive. So for example, when the player picks and launches a new mission to play, the camera will pan to one of the ships docked on the station, as it undocks and leaves for its destination.</p>

    <p>Remember I am only experimenting with this system, and it's likely to change and evolve a lot in the future.</p>
    <p>This was sort of a smaller developer article, but I just want to be making more of these.</p>
