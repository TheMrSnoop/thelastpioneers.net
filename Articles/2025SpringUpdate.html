    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>2025 Spring Update</h1>
    <h3>APRIL 2, 2025 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">I spent a lot of the Fall working on an "Interactive Orbit Menu". It's basically just a menu that allowed you to kinda mess with the planets in 3D space. So you could rotate them, and zoom into them however you like. Now that I look back on it, it was more of a tech demo, than a functional game level selector. Hell, It didn't even work as a mission/level selector, because I kept putting off the actual functionality. So now, I am experimenting with an alternative with the goal of making it, more functional and practical. I am calling this alternative "Mission Hubs".</p>
    <br>
    <h6>The Brief Overview behind the idea</h6>
    <p>Now, every world (Planet or Moon) that you can land on, will have a "Mission Hub" scene. These scenes are backgrounds of something that represents the world at whole. So if your last mission was on The Moon, then you would load up the background of a moon base or something related, while you navigate the UI to pick a new mission. These backgrounds are sort of alive <i>(taking inspiration from the Ready or Not title screen)</i>, which is why I am making them complete levels. So for example, when the player picks and launches a new mission to play, the camera will pan to a rocket leaving the scene, before loading up the new mission level.</p>

    <p>Remember I am only experimenting with this system, and it's likely to change and evolve a lot in the future.</p>
    <p>This was sort of a smaller developer article, but I just want to be making more of these.</p>
