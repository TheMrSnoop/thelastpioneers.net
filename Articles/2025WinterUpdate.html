    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">
        I kinda forgot to do one of these a few weeks ago, so I'll try my best not to include any of the progress I've made since.
    </p>

    <p>I spent a lot of these past few months remaking things I had previously created in the Fall. Mostly the Introduction/Tutorial mission. I had spent almost 3 months working on a tutorial level, just to decide it was too boring, and didn't make much sense. I'm okay with that though, because like I said in a previous Article, it's worth it to me if it means I get to create something better.</p>

    <p>For this new Intro/Tutorial mission, I was able to get a basic introduction cutscene, backstory selector, and the basic terrain of the island laid out. Its still all green grass, I still need to add a proper landscape material, which sometimes can be a pain in the ass. </p>
    
    <p>Aside from the new Intro Level, I also worked a lot on an abandoned Russian City named Stellagrad. I am thinking the background lore will be something like this. <br> <i>Stellagrad was once one of the Soviet's most valuable cities. What was once just a secret launchpad turned into a famous city, symbolizing as the Soviet's head of Space exploration. It has been featured in Soviet propaganda many times. The entire city was powered by a small nuclear reactor, making it completely offgrid in the event of a Cyber Attack.</i></p>

    <p>As of writing this, the map is complete with a rough nuclear reactor region, space for a will be, ruined downtown area, a ruined apartment complex, and a large destroyed steel bridge connecting some of, what once were islands.</p>

    <p>When I first created the actual level, I thought it was going to be the first mission after the player completes the tutorial. While that is still not off the table, I am very much not done writing the story for the game, and so I keep shifting things around to make sense to the plot I am trying to build. So that is why, as of writing this I am thinking about actually making this level for the mid-game, and that means I would have to modify some things to make the difficultly and stuff appropriate for that.  </p>

    <h4>Other Things</h4> 
    <p>I also had spent a good amount of time reworking the Space Combat that I made in July. I created a separate version of it, that makes it feel more like you are piloting a cool Jet, instead of a easy to drift, rocket (if that makes any sense) The map I made at the time for it, is an Alien Ocean World called Proteus. Orbiting a Red Dwarf Star like 20 light years away from Earth. As I continue to write the story, its possible that the game only takes place in our Solar System. In which case, I will just swap the level out for an Earth Ocean. Heres a bit of that.</p>
