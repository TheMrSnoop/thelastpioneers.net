    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>Getting Help with Development</h1>
    <h3>JANUARY 12, 2025 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">I began to realize just how long it was going to take me to finish this highly ambitious game just by myself. I estimated that I would finish this game no sooner than 2-3 years from now, and I am usually pretty bad at guessing how long something will take me. I made a a pie chart to see which parts of development took the longest. Programming, 3D Modeling, and 3D animations took the most amount of time.</p>

    <p>I would say that in terms of development, my biggest strengths are programming, game designing, and graphic design (photo-shopping). With my biggest weaknesses being Music Production, and 3D animation, with ranking my 3D modeling skill as decent.</p>

    <p>One day, out of nowhere really, one of my friends, randomly offered to help create some of the music for the game. I made it clear that, well, I couldn't pay him cuz I ain't got that kinda funds right now. He showed me a beat he made on some Roblox game, and I then proceeded to give him a list of music that would eventually need to be created.</p>

    <p>Another friend of mine, who happened to read the conversation between me and (music man) offered to help me with 3D animations, as he wants to be a professional animator one day. He already has a good amount of background knowledge of animation, so all I had to do was teach him the basics of animating using Blender. He picked it up quickly, and began animating his own list of things that (eventually) needed to be animated.</p>

    <p>Now that I had some sort of team, I needed to do something that I should have done very long ago. Actual playtesting. It had been 10 months since I started working on this game, and not once had someone other then me playtest the game...</p>

    <p>(Animation guy) playtested the latest build of the game, and I really just wanted to make sure the game was playable on GPUs under $1,000. I had him playtest 3 maps with his RTX 4060. An early version of the tutorial mission, an ocean map that showcased atmospheric combat, and a ruined russian city map. The Tutorial ran at a solid 20fps, the ocean map ran at a decent 60fps, and the city map crashed the game everytime he tried to run it...</p>

    <p>Safe to say, there is a lot of optimization work to do...</p>
