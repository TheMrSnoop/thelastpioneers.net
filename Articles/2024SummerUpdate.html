    <h5>The Last Pioneers Game-Dev</h5>
    <h1>2024 Summer Update</h1>
    <h3>JULY 29, 2024 | TheMrSnoop</h3>

    <p style="padding-top: 7%;">
        Considering it was now summer break, I was able to make some serious progress. The game went from a very rough prototype, to more of an actual game by the end of August. 
    </p>

    <p>It was around this time where I spent a lot of time writing the GDD (Game Design Document). Things like the story, and the overall direction of the game got a big buff from this. Since I had been on Summer Break, almost everyday I was getting some serious progress. I worked a lot on a prototype starter/tutorial mission. </p>

    <p>I spent a lot of time building the ground work for what later be a fully complete space combat system. It started with simply getting inside a rocket to escape Earth, to raiding a Soviet Space Station orbiting Mars.</p>

    <p>But The Last Pioneers at it's heart, is supposed to be a cool Space First Person Shooter. And the FPS gameplay was still lacking in content. So I also spent a good amount of time creating the groundwork for that too. Adding better FPS animations, weapons, decent weapon SFX and VFX, and experimenting with different types of movement. I eventually settled for a more grounded, realistic sort of feel to the FPS, but you are still able to use your jetpack to quickly zoom around. Considering the game is supposed to be more of a realistic FPS, I experimented with some "tactical" elements as well. I added a "dynamic armor" system. Meaning that I split all the player's major body segments into separate armor, with their own health. For example, if the player gets shot in their leg enough, the armor breaks, and they now have trouble walking, and can no longer sprint.</p>


    
    <p>
        <i>Some of what this talks about isn't in the game yet</i>
        <br>
        I also experimented with the idea of letting the player choose from one of 3 classes. I had just finished my first play through of Cyberpunk 2077 (fire game), so Im now realizing how similar these are to some Cyberpunk characters. The 3 classes are <b>Commando, Assassin, and Cybersoldier. Commando</b> players are tank like characters. They wear large mechanical exosuits, and can carry heavy weapons. (Like Adam Smasher). <b>Assassin</b> characters are stealty builds. They can quickly, and silently hover, to attack their enemies from the air. Any class will  technically be able to try and play stealthy, but it would be much more difficult to achieve. And finally the <b>Cybersoldier.</b> These players can use hacks to effect enemy technology (literally just Cyberpunk netrunners)
